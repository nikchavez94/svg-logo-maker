# svg-logo-maker

## Functionality
Use this application to create a simple logo. 

## Code 
The code was created first by adding variables that would require "inquirer." After that the filesystems was set to a variable. Also, the js file with the codes for the different shape options. After that, a function was created to group together a set of functions using the <g> tags. The first let variable was created with an if statement. The if statement connects to the users choice of shape. If they don't choose Triangle, then create a Square, if not a square, then create a circle. Each of those statements also had an attachment using string literals that specified that users color and text input will be connected in the final product. The last funciton that was created was a prompt set to ask users about their specific logo needs. After being asked and answered, a logo will be loaded and can be opened on a browswer to view their new svg logo file.
